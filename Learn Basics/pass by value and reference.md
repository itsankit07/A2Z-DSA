It seems like there might be a slight typo in your question. I assume you meant "Pass by Value" and "Pass by Reference." Let me explain both concepts in the context of C++.

### Pass by Value:

In pass by value, the actual value of the argument is passed to the function. Any modifications made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original value.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function declaration
void square(int x) {
    x = x * x;
    std::cout << "Inside function: " << x << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    square(num);
    std::cout << "Outside function: " << num << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the value of `num` remains unchanged outside the function despite modifying `x` inside the `square` function. This is because the function receives a copy of the argument.

### Pass by Reference:

In pass by reference, a reference to the actual variable is passed to the function. Any changes made to the parameter inside the function affect the original value.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function declaration
void square(int &x) {
    x = x * x;
    std::cout << "Inside function: " << x << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    square(num);
    std::cout << "Outside function: " << num << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Now, the value of `num` is changed both inside and outside the function because the function receives a reference to the original variable. The `&` symbol is used to denote a reference parameter.

### When to Use Each:

- Use pass by value when you don't want the function to modify the original value of the argument and want to work with a copy.
  
- Use pass by reference when you want the function to modify the original value of the argument or when working with large data structures to avoid the overhead of copying.

Understanding the difference between pass by value and pass by reference is crucial for designing efficient and effective functions in C++.
